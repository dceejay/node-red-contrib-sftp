node-red-contrib-sftp
=====================

An SFTP node for Node-RED, a wrapper for [ssh2-sftp-client](https://github.com/theophilusx/ssh2-sftp-client)

This is a clone of the original node-red-contrib-sftp versions by @jonferreira and @schattenmann, updated by @dceejay to use the latest client library.

v1.0.2 now hides the credentials properly using the Node-RED built in credentials handler.

Install
-------

Either use the Manage Palette option in the Node-RED Editor menu, or run the following command in your Node-RED user directory - typically `~/.node-red`

    npm i @dceejay/node-red-contrib-sftp
